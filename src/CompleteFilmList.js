    description:
      "John McClane gets more than he bargained for while away to pick up his ex-wife at her office Christmas party. A quality Alan Rickman doing some mentally hammy accents meets Bruce Willis, who at the time was considered a laughable choice for the role as he'd only been in a daft romantic comedy.",
    pairings: 'Some boring lagers, a burger and crisps.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Jingle All The Way',
    pic: jingle,
    description:
      "Arnie stars in a film which at best makes no sense and at worst is quite upsetting. Making the list out of a combination of nostalgia and the fact that the late, great Phil Hartman plays a philandering house-husband 100% straight, the film's bizarre charm somehow helps you overlook the fact that it also features Jim Belushi and Jake Lloyd.",
    pairings:
      'Red Stripe (for the scene where Arnie gives it to a reindeer) and home-made cookies',
  },
  {
    title: 'Black Christmas',
    pic: blkXmas,
    description:
      'Sorority-house slasher whose menacing phone calls and wise-cracking teens predate Scream. Very vibey, still holds up, and stars a pre-Superman Margot Kidder. Subdued 70s lighting and gaudy set design set the mood perfectly, and another great entry into the pantheon of horror films which came out to pearl-clutching critical panning then slowly grew from cult following to widespread acclaim.  ',
    pairings: 'Not sure yet',

    title: 'Eyes Wide Shut',
    pic: eyes,
    description:
      "Surreal and contentious Kubrick thriller. Regardless of one's overall opinions on the film, it stands as a noticeable oddball on the list and, I feel, helps to offset some of the more on-the-nose inclusions. Kubrick's flair for lighting (and just about everything else) combined with Hollywood A-listers playing very rich people makes for an unsettling dreamlike haze throughout, but I think it's the real-life marital tension between Kidman and Cruise which push it over the edge and onto the list.",
    pairings:
      'A nice selection of up-market booze, maybe a decent wine or cognac.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Miracle on 34th Street',
    pic: miracle,
    description:
      'Smashing remake that plays the "Christmas thing" straighter than most, a cut from the Second Golden Age of John Hughes. An always on-form Mara Wilson shares excellent chemistry with a Richard Attenborough who seems to have walked off the set of the previous year\'s Jurassic Park and into a Santa suit, still in character.',
    pairings: 'Milk and Maryland cookies for that American wean feeling.',
  },

    title: "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation",
    pic: lampoons,
    description:
      "A solid entry in a series of films which hold up surprisingly well (written by...oh, that explains it), my dad's favourite and a great case for forgetting that Chevy Chase is a real-life arsehole. Easy-watching comedy of errors with no surprises, except for Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis playing the weans in this one.",
    pairings:
      "A properly-cooked turkey, to make up for the one they didn't manage in the film.",
  },
  {
    title: 'Scrooged',
    pic: scrooged,
    description:
      'The winner of several Dickens adaptations which were considered. Any collection which includes Chevy Chase has to similarly tip the cap to the anti-Chevy. A bit tonally confused at times, which if anything just adds to the story, and nobody plays "Are we meant to cheer for this character or not?" quite like Bill Murray.',

    description:
      'A Tim Burton effort from around the time it was still cool to be Tim Burton, and a particularly nice vibe collision for me as I used to be really scared of it as a boy.',

    title: 'Jack Frost',
    pic: frost,
    description:
      'A fairly lame family romp with very "special" special effects, rescued from ridiculous obscurity by a Michael Keaton performance utterly devoid of self-consciousness. The bonus points which nudged it onto the list come from my looking for it in a video rental shop (a real, 90s, VHS video rental shop) and stumbling across the slasher flick of the same name - fond memories for a budding horror fan.',
    pairings: 'A snow cone...brrr.',
  },

  {
    title: 'The Santa Clause',
    pic: clause,
    description:
      "Tim Allen was once arrested for trying to smuggle hunners of ching through an airport. My enduring mental association with him, but not enough to spoil this film. Logged a lot of views of this one growing up, but can't remember it too well now. Looking forward to it all coming rushing back to me - the cast is very promising.",
    pairings: 'A ceaser salad, with dressing on the side.',

    title: 'The Polar Express',
    pic: polar,
    description:
      "Tom Hanks mo-cap modern fairytale. Somehow managed to miss out on it over the years. Posters remind me of Snowpiercer but its regular inclusion on Auntie Beeb's Christmas telly rotation suggest that tonally, they may be quite different.",

      'A nice warming Christmas hot choc, with lots of marshmallows & cream.',

    pic: noel,
    description:
      'A French drama film I saw on the BFI list of Top 10 Independent Christmas films (and a few others - seems popular!). Translates to "A Christmas Tale" and features a large multi-generational family meeting up for a Christmas dinner. I reckon it will be a bit light-hearted but not sure.',
    pairings: 'Something French - Brie and a Kronenbourg?',

  {
    title: 'Carol',
    pic: carol,
    description:
      'An "alternative Christmas romance" film starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara with high praise from critics. Mid-century period piece, which is not usually for me, but think it will work really well. Nominated for bags of prestigious awards and a ringing endorsement from Kermode earned it a spot on this list. Also based on a Patricia Highsmith novel, which can only be a good thing. ',
    pairings: 'Super-dry martinis, per the period',
  },

  {
    title: 'The Apartment',
    pic: apartment,
    description:
      'An Oscar-winning Jack Lemmon/Shirley MacLaine feature, which I saw once years ago on a Billy Wilder bender. Can\'t remember a lot about it but the premise and subject matter leave a lot of room for an excellent Christmas "thinker".',
    pairings:
      'A bourbon Old-Fashioned...seems pretty old. And a wee bit of fruitcake.',

    description:
      'One of two French entries on the list, sounds like a classic opposites-attract kind of thing, and one synopsis I read mentioned Marxism - VERY ahead of its time.',

    description:
      "The all time, undisputed, greatest champion of them all. Absolutely everything that a Christmas film could or should be - humanity, humour, sentimentality and warmth perfectly captured in 103 minutes. Career-defining performances from just about everyone in the cast (only Pesci and Candy came close to this level in their other output), a flawlessly-paced script from John Huges and a wonderfully hip soundtrack that still somehow pays due respect to the greatest hits. Not only the best Christmas film of all time, but very possibly the best film of all time. Well, it's either that or Space Odyssey.",

      "Absolutely anything you want. You've earned it. Have yourself a merry little Christmas.",
