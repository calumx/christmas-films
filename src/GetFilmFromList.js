Making the list out of a combination of nostalgia and the fact that the late, great Phil Hartman plays a philandering house-husband 100% straight, the film's bizarre charm somehow helps you overlook the fact that it also features Jim Belushi and Jake Lloyd.",

Not only the best Christmas film of all time, but very possibly the best film of all time. Well, it's either that or Space Odyssey.",
