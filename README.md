# Christmas Films: An Advent Calendar

An 'advent calendar' counting down the days until Christmas, ensuring you squeeze maximum joy out of every Yuletide moment by offering up a filmic festive favourite, complete with appropriate food & drink pairings. I've tried to go for a healthy mix of well-worn classics and contemporary takes (plus some not-so-surprising surprises on the 24th and 25th) but of course substitutions are welcomed and encouraged.

Still very much a work in progress so you may find many features buggy, broken or altogether absent!
